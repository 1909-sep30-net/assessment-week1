//code in branch named according to your first name, lowercase(with last initial as needed).

//two projects, a library project and a unit test project.

//library should have a class that can tell me whether a string is a palindrome or not.

//all the behavior of the class should be unit tested.

//a palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.
//for example, these should be considered palindromes:
//    "nurses run"
//    "racecaR"
//    "1221"
//    "never odd, or even."
//for example, these should not be considered palindromes:
//    "one two one"
//    "123abccba123"
//follow git and c# best practices.
